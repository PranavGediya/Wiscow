 ðŸ”„ Deployment Workflow

Continuous Integration (Automated)
When you push to main branch:
1. âœ… GitHub Actions builds Docker image
2. âœ… Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
3. âœ… Image is publicly available

Continuous Deployment (Manual)
After the build completes:
```powershell

**Note**: Automatic deployment to local Minikube is not possible from GitHub Actions as it cannot reach localhost. For full automation, deploy to a cloud Kubernetes cluster.
